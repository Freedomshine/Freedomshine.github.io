    <p>Yes, the increase of lawlessness does indeed affect the environment, and even people&rsquo;s love. Yes, members of the Communist Party of China and their children can immigrate all over the world and enjoy prosperity, while our brothers and sisters in China suffer in prison and persecution. However, we who live by relying on the Lord must face this by depending on Him, for it is the Lord’s reward that is most precious. Recently, I have increasingly felt that the Lord’s name is precious and have increasingly felt unworthy of His reward, because I was once a sinner, an enemy of God, yet I received God’s mercy, so that God&rsquo;s glory might be shown through me, an ungodly person. The Lord loved me first, so I willingly learn from the Lord&rsquo;s example, to love others, even my enemies, to let go of my anger and hatred, and to pray for them. I pray for the Communist officials and their children in Canada, hoping they will repent. Canada has many churches of God, and I hope they can come to know God in this free country. For only love can overcome evil; only God can overcome evil; only those who rely on God and endure to the end will be saved! I pray that I may understand that all things will pass away, and only Christ is precious to me. Amen.</p>
<p>“I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called.” (Ephesians 4:1, ESV)</p>
<p>“Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.” (Romans 12:14, ESV)</p>
<p>“And we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.” (1 Corinthians 4:12-13, ESV)</p>
<p>“To the contrary, ‘if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink;’” (Romans 12:20, ESV)</p>
<p>“Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ.” (Philippians 3:8, ESV)</p>
<p>I am very content with what God has given me, and I want to learn from Paul, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, pressing on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
