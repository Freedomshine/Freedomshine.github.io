    <p>​Hi, Ben,</p>
<p>I wish yesterday&rsquo;s spiritual conversation, especially the part about China did not give you a negative influence.  I wish I could share with you more biblical thoughts in my perspective.</p>
<p>I believe that as the economy declines,  violent crime rates tend to rise in a society under high-pressure governance. I would like to call China a social Darwinism Society because we were brainwashed to believe it. </p>
<p>The authorities educate the public that the wealth of the rich comes from their hard work totally, promoting the idea of &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; while claiming the poor deserve to be poor and serve the rich and power.   A senior CCP general even remarked, &ldquo;If you want regime change, be prepared 30 million heads for exchange.&rdquo; This reflects an extremely terrifying reality: sin profoundly influences this world. Actually, all humans are slaves of sin. The whole world system is Slavery, ruled by sin and satan.</p>
<p>It also highlights the difficulty of acquiring resources; not everyone is born in countries like Canada or the United States. Many are born into extreme poverty and under authoritarian regimes. For many, their fate may have been determined at the moment of their birth. They are unaware that they are destined to fail in the competition of this secular world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>​Genesis‬3:17-18 ESV</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>​cursed is the ground because of you;<br>
​in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;<br>
thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you;</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Perhaps some party members or Americans think that their lives are rich and abundant enough, they are so proud of the countries where their citizenship is. </p>
<p>But, We can say that most people in the world, their lives are so miserable.  Although many are unwilling to admit it, their lives are marked by sins, failure and degradation. They deceive and brainwash themselves to avoid acknowledging it. I am one of them in the past. </p>
<p>We live in an extremely painful and tragic world that we have no choice but to face， especially for the poor and disabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‪Romans‬8:20 ESV<br>
20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it.</p></blockquote>
<p>​The reality of the whole world, including the continuous failures of the Israelites in the Bible, reminds us that we cannot change the situation by ourselves, and we cannot break the chains of sin and hatred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>​<strong>Q2</strong>: What must you know to live and die in the joy of this comfort?<br>
<strong>A</strong>:<br>
First, how great my sins and misery are;<br>
Second, how I am delivered from all my sins and misery;<br>
Third, how I am to thank God for such deliverance.</p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‪Romans‬8:22-23 ESV<br>
22 For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. 23 And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‪Matthew‬9:35-38 ESV<br>
35 And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. 36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;38 therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>​<strong>Q8</strong>: But are we so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined to all evil?<br>
<strong>A</strong>:<br>
Yes, unless we are regenerated by the Spirit of God.</p></blockquote>
<p>​I am so blessed to know the Good News, my king and ruler is in the heaven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.”</strong> <em>(Matthew 3:11, ESV)</em><br>
<strong>“我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改。但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。”</strong> <em>（马太福音 3:11，和合本）</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.”</strong> <em>(Ezekiel 36:26, ESV)</em><br>
<strong>“我也要赐给你们一个新心，将新灵放在你们里面，又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。”</strong> <em>（以西结书 36:26，和合本）</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”</strong> <em>(2 Corinthians 5:17, ESV)</em><br>
<strong>“若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人，旧事已过，都变成新的了。”</strong> <em>（哥林多后书 5:17，和合本）</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.”</strong> <em>(2 Corinthians 3:18, ESV)</em><br>
<strong>“我们众人既然敞着脸得以看见主的荣光，好像从镜子里反照，就变成主的形状，荣上加荣，如同从主的灵变成的。”</strong> <em>（哥林多后书 3:18，和合本）</em></p></blockquote>
<p>愿主的圣灵和火引领你走向一个全新的生命，充满祂的荣耀和祝福！</p>
